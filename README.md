# 🚧 PRODIGY_DS_05 – Traffic Accident Data Analysis

This repository contains the implementation for **Task-05** of the Prodigy InfoTech Data Science Internship.

## 📌 Task Objective

> **Analyze traffic accident data** to identify patterns related to **road conditions**, **weather**, and **time of day**.  
> Visualize accident **hotspots** and other contributing factors using data analytics and visualization techniques.

## 📁 Dataset

- **Dataset Name:** Road Traffic Accidents (Cleaned)
- **Source:** [Kaggle – Road Traffic Accidents in Addis Ababa]([https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/samiwazow/road-traffic-accidents](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/saurabhshahane/road-traffic-accidents))
- **File Used:** `cleaned.csv` (preprocessed version of original dataset)
- **Size:** Small and suitable for EDA (~ few MBs)

---

## 🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The notebook includes:
- ✅ **Data Loading & Inspection**
- ✅ **Categorical breakdowns and frequency analysis**
- ✅ **Bar plots** to explore:

  - `Accident_severity`
  - `Weather_conditions`
  - `Road_surface_type`
  - `Light_conditions`

---

## 📊 Visualizations

- `Seaborn` and `Matplotlib` were used to create bar plots showing:
  - Impact of different **weather** and **lighting conditions** on accidents
  - Frequency distribution of **accident severity**
  - Relationship between **road surfaces** and accident counts

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies Used

- Python
- Google Colab
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn

---

## ✅ Outcome

This project provided insights into the **main contributing factors** behind road accidents using real-world data. The analysis can help highlight areas of concern that can be addressed through better road and traffic management.
